Algorithm Playground: A DAA Project

This is a comprehensive, interactive web application built for a "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" innovative project. It provides a visual representation of various algorithms in action, allowing users to understand not only how they work but also why they have their specific time and space complexity.

This entire application is built within a single HTML file, leveraging modern web technologies to create a responsive and powerful learning tool.

‚ú® Features

Interactive Visualizations: Watch algorithms run step-by-step with adjustable speed.

Dynamic Complexity Analysis: A dedicated panel instantly updates to show the Time (Best, Average, Worst) and Space Complexity for the selected algorithm, complete with a plain-English explanation.

Multiple Algorithm Categories: Explore a wide range of algorithms across four distinct categories.

Adjustable Controls:

Sorting/Searching: Control the visualization speed and the size of the array.

Pathfinding: Draw custom "wall" barriers on the grid, and drag-and-drop the Start and End nodes.

Zero-Setup: Runs entirely in the browser. No build process, no dependencies, no server required.
